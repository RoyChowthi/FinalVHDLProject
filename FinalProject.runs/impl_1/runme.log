WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net blue_temp_reg[5]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin blue_temp_reg[5]/L3_2/O, cell blue_temp_reg[5]/L3_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
